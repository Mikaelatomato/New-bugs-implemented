# New-bugs-implemented
Here i'll upload all my work while learning python.

and before the next so; so, i know that some files aren't working properly, and i don't think to fix them, sorry.

so, i may stop working on python for a while since i'm learning java now because of my university. I'll be uploading my work of java on a different repository if you want to check it out too and give me some comments about what could be better :)

that's all
